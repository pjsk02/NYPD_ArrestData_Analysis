## 📁 Dataset Details  
- 📄 **Source**: NYPD Arrests Dataset  
- 📊 **Records**: 260,503 rows × 19 columns  
- 🎯 **Grain**: Each row = 1 arrest record  
- 🗃️ **Key Attributes**: Date, Crime Type, Location, Demographics

## 🧱 Data Warehouse Design

### ⭐ Star Schema Tables

**Fact Table**
- `Arrest_Fact`: Central table capturing arrest transactions

**Dimension Tables**
- `DIM_Time`: Date, Day, Month, Year  
- `DIM_Crime`: Offense details, PD_CD, LAW_CAT_CD  
- `DIM_Location`: Borough, Precinct, Latitude/Longitude  
- `DIM_Preperator`: Age, Race, Gender

## 📊 Tableau Dashboards

### 1️⃣ Time-Based Analysis  
- Arrest trends by day, week, month, quarter, and year  
- 📈 Peak crime dates: March 14, August, September

### 2️⃣ Crime Patterns & Trends  
- Top 5 crimes: Assault, Petit Larceny, etc.  
- 🚨 Drug-related crimes have decreased; Larceny increased

### 3️⃣ Geographic Analysis  
- 🔍 Brooklyn & Manhattan are top crime hotspots  
- Precinct 14 has the highest arrest count

### 4️⃣ Demographic Breakdown  
- Highest arrests: Age 18–25, Male, Black & Hispanic individuals

### 5️⃣ Predictive & Preventive Insights  
- Heatmaps of future hotspots using historical density  
- Summer shows forecasted crime spikes

## 📈 Sample DDL: Fact Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE Arrest_Fact(
    ARREST_KEY VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL,
    PD_CD_SK INT NOT NULL,
    ARREST_PRECINCT_SK INT NOT NULL,
    DATE_SK CHAR(10) NOT NULL,
    PREP_ID_SK INT NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (ARREST_KEY, PD_CD_SK, ARREST_PRECINCT_SK, DATE_SK, PREP_ID_SK)
);
```

More tables: `DIM_Crime`, `DIM_Time`, `DIM_Location`, `DIM_Preperator`
